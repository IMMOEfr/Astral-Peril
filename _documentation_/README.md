# UFO Logic:
# UFO sprite has an idle animated state
# I want to cycle through the PNG cycle all the time
# and I want him to render on the screen.

# the UFO will stay in position, but it will look at the mouse cursor (meaning it will probably rotate)
# There will be a health bar on the top of the screen
# When the mouse is clicked, the UFO will shoot at a trajectory for half a second and slow down to a stop.
# While the ufo is moving, we keep track at every coordinate he is traveling through and store that in a list
